# Product & Company Management System
**WorldSkills Americas – Santiago 2025**

This project was developed as a technical challenge during **WorldSkills Americas 2025 (Santiago, Chile)**.  
It focuses on building a simplified product management system with a **public API**, a **public product page**, and a **protected administration panel**.

The solution was designed to be completed within a limited time frame (approximately 3 hours), while maintaining basic standards of **code quality, server-side validation, and accessibility**.

This project allows an administrator to:

- Register **companies** and their **products**
- Expose visible products through a **public JSON API**
- Display product information on a **public web page**
- Manage data through a **secure admin dashboard**
